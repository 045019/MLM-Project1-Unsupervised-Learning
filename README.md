Crafting Clusters: Unveiling Beer Recipe Patterns with Machine Learning

# Project Overview

This project explores a dataset containing beer recipes to gain insights into the distribution of recipes based on attributes like style, batch size, alcohol content, bitterness, and more. Machine learning clustering algorithms are employed to group similar beer recipes together, aiming to uncover patterns and similarities among different styles of beer. By analyzing the resulting clusters, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the characteristics and ingredients that define various beer styles.
